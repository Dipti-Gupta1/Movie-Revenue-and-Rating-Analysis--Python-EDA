This repository contains all the code and visualizations produced during the analysis.




# Movie Data Analysis with Python

## Overview

This repository contains an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset with 1,000 movies. The goal is to uncover interesting patterns and insights related to movie ratings, revenues, genres, and other attributes using Python.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and visualizations.
- **scripts**: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and optimized data types to ensure smooth analysis.
- Checked for data consistency and corrected any anomalies.

### Correlation Analysis
- Conducted a thorough correlation analysis to uncover relationships between different variables.
- Highlight: Found a positive correlation (0.22) between movie ratings and revenue.

### Visualizations
- Created various plots to visualize the data effectively.
- Example: A bar plot showing the frequency of movie genres, sorted by count.

### Insights
- Higher-rated movies tend to have higher revenues.
- Action and Drama are the most common genres.
- Directors and actors significantly impact a movieâ€™s success.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Primary language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data handling and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive and iterative analysis.
